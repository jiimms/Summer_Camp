                        <p class="tm-subtitle">
                            English is the largest global language used for communication across the world.
                            Knowing English is a pre-requisite for gainful employment anywhere in the world.
                            English skills are required for you even for migration to the west.
                            Most inventions and products are made and marketed in English.
                            India has recognised its importance and has made English an official language in addition to Hindi. <br>
                            Good English helps you perform with confidence in your interviews.</br>
                            Make your kids future ready.<br>
                            A  new study finds that poor English-speaking skills are limiting the employment and earning prospects of Indiaâ€™s engineering graduates.<br>
                            A new study has found that even for kids studying in english medium schools and with english text books, their level of english comprehension is often lacking. This results in them performing below their capabilities. The lack of english comprehension and composition skills encourages learning by rote thereby severely limiting a student from reaching his or her true potential.<br>

On the other hand children with increased level of english comprehension outperform their peers to a greater degree. A higher level of english comprehension and composition skill also helps students in performing better in all other subjects along with helping in their overall personality development.<br>

A better grasp on English also helps the students as they progress to higher classes and later for higher studies. <br>
Poor English will keep you away from premier Institutes/ gain you entry
